# Submit Your Hacktoberfest Repos to up-for-grabs!

As [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) descends in less than a week (!!!), I wanted to give a shoutout to [up-for-grabs.net](https://up-for-grabs.net/).

{% github up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net %}

I find it a super useful resource when looking for OSS to contribute to with my current skillset. I'd love for others who are prepping their projects for Hacktoberfest to make use of it - or those who are also exploring what's out there.

If you are prepping your repos for Hacktoberfest, you can use the Hacktoberfest label as the "beginner-friendly" tag when submitting. [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/), an open source implementation of Function as a Service, and [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), "the leading open alternative to Google Analytic", both use their "Hacktoberfest" issue labels in this manner, for example.

Hope you find this resource as helpful as I do. I'm more than happy to assist with any PRs if you want your repo added to the listing. Good luck during Hacktoberfest!
